    "intro": "Labyrinth is a 1986 musical fantasy film following a 16-year-old girl named Sarah who must reach the center of an otherworldly maze in just thirteen hours in order to rescue her infant brother. With a budget of $25 million and a final theatrical gross of $12.9 million, the film was considered to be a box office failure with mixed critical reviews. Today, it has a cult following and is considered by many to be a classic. Be careful what you wish for, and take a look behind the scenes into the wonky world of Labyrinth. ",

        "content": "Before Labyrinth became the classic that many know and love today, the script for the film traded hands, a lot. Illustrator Brian Froud first pitched his idea of a baby surrounded by goblins to Jim Henson after a screening of The Dark Crystal. Jim Henson and Dennis Lee then came up with a story which was given to Monty Python's Terry Jones and Fraggle Rock's Laura Phillips, who each wrote a script.Finally, it was passed on to screenwriter Elaine May did her own revisions to make the characters feel more human. Although the lone screenwriting credits went to Jones, he didn't feel \"very close\" to it because his version and the final version were so different.See how there is foreshadowing of the film all over Sarah's room."

As a note to Sendak, in the movie's credits, it reads, \"Jim Henson acknowledges his debt to the works of Maurice Sendak.\" Regardless, Sendak complained about it for years.\n"

        "content": "Many raptors are solitary animals, while vultures are much more social and have no problem feeding, flying and roosting with their own kind. A group of vultures is called a committee, venue, or volt. When you see several vultures in flight, they are known as a kettle.\nA bunch of vultures feeding together on one carcass is known as a wake. While there are several names for groups of vultures engaging in various tasks, there is one common thread -- they all look a little spooky when they travel, eat, or chill out in a pack.\n"

The reason why they're so quiet is because New World vultures don't have voice boxes.

They may do this when they're alarmed or in uncomfortable situations. But in general, you can't rely on them making any sounds in order to announce their presence.\n"

Instead, they stay quiet and neutral on all issues and always refrain from casting their votes so that they can remain relatable to everyone, not just the people who happen to agree with their beliefs.\n"

    "intro": "In 2003, the dysfunctional ex-wealthy family, the Bluth's, was introduced to the world on the series Arrested Development. Presented with voiceovers, archive footage, and more running gags than there are episodes, the series quickly became a cult classic. And only those die-hard's would know these facts.\nFrom Jason Bateman's Michael taking a dig at Jeffrey Tambor's Emmy loss to how  Liza Minnelli wound up playing Lucile 2, here are some extraordinarily dysfunctional facts about Arrest Development.",

You’re a regular Brad Garrett.\"In 2005, Tambour lost out of a Primetime Emmy Award Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series to none other than Brad Garrett. It was a slight dig but absolutely hysterical for those who follow award shows.The original idea for the show was based on a family from a few J.D. Salinger short stories. And, wow, to say the family is opposite from the idea would be an understatement."

Lindsay is the only character that was rewritten with a particular actor in mind for the role.\n"

And many types of spiders don't have fangs that are large enough to puncture human skin. Although some spiders do bite, it's usually when they're feeling threatened or surprised -- so leave them alone!\n"

More huge spiders. We're not saying it's time to prepare for a spider invasion just yet, though.\n"

They must be good flyers to survive, because they only eat prey they catch while they're flying. This means that if they can't fly, they'll starve to death.\nThey catch their prey by grabbing it with their feet. Harvard University did a study on dragonfly hunting behaviors and found that the insects caught 90 to 95 percent of the prey that was released into their enclosure!\n"

    "intro": "Born in 111 BC, Spartacus was a Thracian gladiator who became one of the escaped slave leaders in the Third Servile War. After escaping captivity, he went on to establish a massive slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Although not much is known about his life outside of the war, it is agreed that he was a former gladiator turned successful military leader. Today, he is viewed as a symbol for the oppressed fighting against the powers that controlled them, although his intentions remain unclear. So, take a look back to see how one man went from an enslaved gladiator to one of the most revered war heroes in ancient history. ",

    "title": "Do You Know What The Real Name For The Hashtag Symbol Is?",
    "intro": "The use of the hashtag symbol has grown exponentially in the last decade, as social media became a cultural norm. Blogger Chris Messina was the first to suggest the use of the hashtag on social media, in a 2007 tweet. In addition to Twitter, the hashtag has since carried over into other social media platforms, including Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and Tumblr.\nSome people are used to referring to the symbol as a \"pound sign\", from hearing it over the telephone while calling information numbers. But did you know that the true name of the hashtag symbol is 'octothorpe'? The Merriam-Webster dictionary notes that the 'octo' prefix is in reference to the eight points of the hashtag symbol. However, no one has officially defined what the 'thorpe' component derives from. The online dictionary also notes that it was used by telephone workers in the 1960s. Whatever the exact derivative of it may be, it's highly unlikely that the name 'octothorpe' will make a comeback any time soon. We'll just stick with 'hashtag', thanks.",

    "title": "Why Scotland’s National Animal Is The Unicorn",
    "intro": "National animals are selected as representations of a country's spirit. Some countries choose animals that signify freedom, such as America's eagle. England's lion embodies strength. And Italy selected the wolf, an animal that represents solidarity with fellow countrymen. Scotland's national animal is different from these because it doesn't exist in real life and is commonly associated with glittery children's toys today. This animal is the unicorn. \nAlthough it might seem like an odd choice at first, there's very good reason for the revered creature to represent Scotland.\nThe country's history is rich in myths and legends, full of stories involving creatures like ghosts, witches, and fairies. For thousands of years, Scots (and many other Western civilizations) believed that unicorns existed, and people saw them as symbols of power, pride, innocence, and purity. A French naturalist named Georges Cuvier claimed in 1825 that unicorns were a physical impossibility, but this did little to dampen the admiration that Scots held for the animals.\nSince the 15th Century, many monarchs of Scotland used the unicorn in their coat of arms, with kings selecting the beast as the ultimate representation of power. It was adopted as Scotland's national animal by King Robert in the late 1300s. The current royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom is supported by a unicorn for Scotland and a lion for England.\nApril 9th was designated National Unicorn Day and is widely celebrated each year. And people who travel to Scotland will discover many unicorns of various shapes and sizes in a number of locations throughout the country including palaces, castles, and churches.\nAs the Scottish Tourist Guide Association has stated, the unicorn has \"long been a symbol of purity and power, but also of virginity and subtlety. And those values still stand up when thinking about Scotland today. These are characteristics embedded in the Scottish psyche.”",

    "intro": "The Northern Cardinal is one of the most-recognized visitors to bird feeders across North America. These delightful songbirds featured raised crests on their heads and orangish-red bills. The males are a vibrant red except for a black area on their faces, while females are light brown, with reddish highlights and dark colorations around their eyes and beak. These birds are medium-sized, averaging about 8 inches. \nPeople across a wide range of North America are able to watch and enjoy cardinals right in their own backyards, thanks to the fact that the birds are found throughout the eastern and central regions of America year-round. If you enjoy watching cardinals, you'll love these fun facts about them.\n• They do not migrate! Unlike many other birds, northern cardinals do not migrate and live near thickets and shrubbery that they can hide and nest in.\n• Cardinals are so well-liked that they've been named the official bird of seven U.S. states: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n• They got their name from the males' bright red plumage, which reminded European settlers of the rich red vestments of Catholic cardinals. The bird's crest also reminded some of the headwear worn by other religious officials.\n• Both males and females are songbirds, although the females usually have more elaborate songs than males. Cardinals' songs vary according to their geographic location.\n• One cardinal may have more than two dozen song variations, and different geographic populations often have quite different songs.\n• Cardinals mate for life. Mated pairs are often seen feeding together, and the males sometimes feed the females seeds in a gesture that looks like a kiss.\n• Cardinals are popular mascots for sports teams. Pro teams include the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team and the Arizona Cardinals NFL team, and there are a variety of college and universities who call themselves Cardinals.",

Upon inheriting their father's chocolate company, Richard found an improved way to extract cocoa butter, resulting in an excess amount that could be used for more varieties of chocolate.\nIn a streak of marketing genius, Richard produced heart-shaped boxes and decorated them for Valentine's Day. The boxes were a hit, especially since they could be kept as mementos and repurposed.\n"

    "intro": "On September 24, 1964, a family of benign monsters moved into the living room of millions of Americans. The Munsters became an immediate hit thanks to its quirky lineup of characters led by Herman and Lily Munster. The series quickly resonated with viewers who admired its satirical take on the more traditional and wholesome family shows—despite the fact that it was produced by the creators of Leave It To Beaver. The series only aired for two years, eventually losing out to ABC’s Batman which aired at the same time (and in color). But the show lived on in syndication, where a new audience was discovered and eventually a movie was produced. It’s been more than 50 years since The Munsters aired a new episode, making it the perfect time to catch up with the show’s stars and talk about some of the lesser-known facts about the admired but short-lived TV series.",

    "intro": "Although they're brightly-colored now, historically, tennis balls were either black or white. The color depended on the background color of the courts. \nThe advent of color television changed that, as audiences had a difficult time seeing the ball. Yellow was found to be the most visible color on television, so the International Tennis Federation began allowing the use of yellow balls in 1972.\nEver adhering to tradition, Wimbledon used white balls for several more years, until 1986.\nInterestingly, there is some debate today over what people think the true color of today’s tennis balls are. A recent Twitter poll of 30,000 people found that  52 percent think a tennis ball is green, 42 percent call it yellow, and 6 percent selected \"other.\"\nMarina Koren picked the story up for The Atlantic and interviewed Bevil Conway, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health who specializes in color perception. She wanted to find a possible explanation for the discrepancy.\nConway explained, “I can think of many more orange or red objects—apples, tomatoes, cherries, most fruit, faces, etc. So it might not be surprising that there is some disagreement about the color of tennis balls.\"\n“They are an odd color, designed to be odd so that they are especially visible on the court. But because they are odd, we haven’t resolved how to label them,” he continued. What do you think? Are tennis balls yellow or green?",

    "intro": "The town of Longyearbyen, located in the Svalbard Islands of Norway, is the world's northernmost settlement that has more than 1,000 permanent residents. Longyearbyen had 2,144 residents as of 2015. The remote town is notable for having some pretty bizarre laws.\nFor starters, cats have been banned since the 1990s. Norwegian authorities decided that felines were overly susceptible to rabies and tapeworm infections, which they thought were big risks to humans. The ban was also enacted in order to protect the island's birds. Photos taken before the 1990s indicate that cats were a popular pet before they were permanently banned.\nAlso, anyone venturing outdoors is required by law to carry a rifle in order to protect themselves from polar bears. There are roughly 3,000 polar bears in the area, more than humans, and they pose a \"significant threat.\" Visitors who don't own a weapon can rent one from the town.\nDying on the island is forbidden. It's not technically illegal, but being buried there IS, so dying is not recommended. The terminally ill are flown off the island for the rest of their days, and anyone who dies suddenly in Longyearbyen is brought elsewhere to be interred.\nThe reason for this unique law also comes down to protecting the human population. In 1950, it was discovered that victims who had been buried after a 1918 flu pandemic had still not decomposed. The permafrost that they were buried in is thought to contain live strains of the flu, which is estimated to have wiped out 5% of the world's population.\nOne more thing -- there is also a restriction on how much alcohol each person can buy every month.\nDon't let these strange laws or the threat of polar bears keep you away from Longyearbyen, though. The town offers a variety of activities for tourists, including dog-sledding, hiking, kayaking, and snowmobile safaris.",

With the final season airing in April 2019, let's take a look at the craziest things you might not know about Game of Thrones.",

Sure, you're bound to see a handful of Game of Thrones characters out and about on Halloween, but would you name your child after a character on the show? Apparently, lots of people say yes!Over the last seven years, Khaleesi has been one of the most popular baby names, as well as Daenerys and Sansa. Other names derived from the show have become more popular as the series has progressed. Hopefully, no one will name their child Joffrey."

Kristian Nair, famous for play Hodor, was (and still is) a well-known DJ.\nSpecifically, Nair is a progressive house DJ and used to be the resident disc jockey of Kremlin, a famous gay club in Belfast. When he's not acting, he still DJs at some clubs, occasionally joined by his co-star Arya.\n"

David Peterson is a \"language creator\" who constructs artificial languages for television and movies. He created both the Dothraki and Valyrian languages for the show. Technically there is a legitimate script in Dothraki, but sometimes the characters mess up their lines and just run with it.\nEmilia Clarke, the actress who plays Khaleesi, has even admitted that she’s not sure what she’s saying at certain parts — she just knows it’s important to get the attitude of the script right while acting.\n"

In the episode, Meereenese warriors shout insults at Daenerys in order to taunt her.\nIf you listen closely enough, some of these insults include, \"Your mother was a hamster\" or \"I blow my nose at you!\" These were classic insults from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Perhaps writers should've picked more serious insults since Daenerys wins the battle and frees the Meereenese slaves.\n"

        "content": "Knowing that Game of Thrones is the second-most expensive television show to produce, it's no wonder that the set pieces and props are certified works of art at this point. Everything from the costumes to the swords are crafted with impeccable precision, after all.\nThough these pieces are now invaluable works of art, some have been given away as lavish gifts. Of course, no one deserves one more than George R.R. Martin, who was gifted one of the petrified dragon eggs from season one on his wedding day.\n"

        "content": "King Joffrey is widely accepted among GoT fans as one of the most infuriating characters on the show, if not the most. However, there have been some close contenders for who might actually be the most hated characters on the show, including Ramsay and Cersei.\nIn fact, Lena Headey has said that people hate Cersei so much, that fans have ripped the books from her hands just so she wouldn't sign it! We're sure that Headey is nothing like Cersesi in real life, but this only goes to show how well she plays the character.\n"

You might recall Arya Stark's friend Hot Pie, who baked dire wolf-shaped loaves of bread for the revenge-seeker.\nActor Ben Hawkey, who plays Hot Pie, decided to bring those loaves to the fans when he partnered with the UK-based app Deliveroo to open \"You Know Nothing Jon Dough.\" His pop-up bakery sells loaves just like the ones Hot Pie baked for Ayra in season four.\n"

        "content": "Part of what makes GoT so fantastic is its amazing production value. Every single aspect of the show is produced with a ton of hard work and perhaps no one has a more interesting job than the foley artist. Foley artist Jeffrey Wilhoit and sound editor Tim Kimmel work on all the sound effects for the show.\nThey revealed to Vanity Fair that the scrape of a dragon claw is actually the sound of Lee Press On Nails. And the dragon roars you often hear? Surprisingly, they used the sound of two tortoises mating for one season, in addition to other angry animal sounds.\n"
